      <h2>The 'Exit & Build' Playbook</h2>
      <p>
        My name is [Your Name]. In other circles, I'm known by other handles.

        I'm an ethical hacker. My entire life has been a deep dive into the
        source code of the systems that run our world. [cite: 819] I've seen how the
        digital fortress was built. And I've watched as *our*
        counter-culture, our desire for freedom, gets co-opted, packaged, and
        sold back to us as a corporate product. [cite: 820]
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the truth: The *real* hack isn't just about code. It's about
        <strong>sovereignty</strong>. [cite: 822]
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'AI gurus' want to sell you a $2,000 system that *locks* you in. Big
        Tech wants to give you 'free' tools that *lock* you in. Both are a trap.
        [cite: 823] I'm here to give you the keys. The *real* source code. [cite: 824]

        The <strong>Cypherpunk Café</strong> is our 'Exit.' [cite: 825]

        The <strong>'AI Liberation Playbook'</strong> is our first 'Build.'

          This is the in-person sanctuary. This is for the local Southern

          for our first meetup, you must first pass the initiation test. [cite: 830]

      <h2>Coming Soon: The 'Sovereign Presence' Workshop</h2>
      <p>
        You're looking at it. This site is hosted on a decentralized,
        censorship-resistant domain. It's built on an open-source, Git-based
        workflow. It's 100% sovereign. [cite: 832-833]
      </p>
      <p>
        In this future lab, I'll teach you how I built it, click-by-click.
